Developer Names: Ding (Chris) Hao, Taoming Yu, Yimin (Jane) Pang, Xiang (Shawn) Zhang, Yucheng Yao, Wenyu (Winnie) Yin

Date of project start: September 17, 2024

This project aims to design and develop a specialized pair of glasses equipped with a camera for real-time language translation, providing users with an accessible interface for interacting with foreign languages. We focus on mechanical, electrical, and software design aspects to create a user-friendly experience. The mechanical design involves creating a specific glass frame or find a suitable position to place the camera while ensuring it captures images effectively that include destinated language and the balance of the glasses. The electrical design is centered around circuit design that integrates low-power microcontroller, camera module, and battery storage. The software component involves a mobile or desktop app that connects wirelessly to the camera, utilizing AI to capture the images with user-selected language and translate text from images in real-time.
